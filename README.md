This GitHub repository serves as a launchpad and sitemap for the CA API Gateway developer tools and reference implementations for your organization to implement a CI/CD workflow for your Container Gateway solution development life cycle in ephemeral mode.

There are two main parts of the CI/CD workflow: local Gateway solution development (i.e., design time) and the actual CI/CD pipeline (i.e., run time) - it's important to distinguish the two as you'll be implementing the workflow in stages so that you can understand how the components work together. 

### Design Time: Local Gateway Solution Development
Design Time refers to activities pertaining to the design or development activities of Gateway policy language or services. With the Gateway Developer plugin, you build a GitOps-oriented Gateaway solution development life cycle for the Container Gateway. Design time is a precursor to run time in an Ephemeral Gateway implementation, but can also operate indepedently for non-Ephemeral Gateway implementations. Learn more in the [wiki](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki#design-time-road-to-cicd-with-gitops-oriented-local-development).

### Run Time: CI/CD Pipeline with Log Analytics and Service Metrics
Run Time refers to the activities pertaining to continuous integration, delivery, and deployment activities of the Container Gateway life cycle â€“ automation is used where the described tools allow it. The monitoring of logs and service metrics is also included. Learn more in the [wiki](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki#run-time-cicd-pipeline-in-action-with-log-analytics-and-performance-metrics). 

## About the Beta Release
The Ephemeral Gateway is a work in progress and the contents of this Git repository is intended as a preview for any organization wanting to explore the implementation of a CI/CD workflow for their API Gateway solution development life cyle. We encourage you to give it a try and provide our development and testing teams your [valuable feedback](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/issues)! 

### Features
For this first beta release, we've focused on the following features:
* GitHub repository set up for your GitOps workflow for design time and environment configuration
* Gateway Developer Tools to propagate the import, export, and build tasks for your policies and configurations
* Integration with industry-standard CI/CD tools such as Google Kubernetes Engine, Weave Flux, Jenkins, and Nexus

### Applicability and System Requirements
For a high-level overview of the CI/CD workflow and its core components, we highly recommend that you review the [reference architecture](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Ephemeral-Gateway-Reference-Architecture) of the Ephemeral Gateway in the general Wiki.  

| Requirement | Supported/Tested in Beta Version |

## Known Limitations
See [Known Limitations](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Known-Limitations) in the Wiki.

## Reference Implementations
A brief description of the various GitHub repositories in CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools is described in the 
[Beta Release Respositories and Reference Implementations](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Beta-Release-Repositories-and-Reference-Implementations) wiki page. We highly recommened you to go through this link to become familiar with the various terms and repos used in this Beta release.

## Ephemeral Gateway Setup Guide
To test the beta release of the Ephemeral Gateway, follow the steps in this [master setup guide](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/ephemeral-gateway-setup-guide). From there, it'll link you to other guides to set up each component from design time (e.g, the Gateway developer Git repository) to run time (e.g, Helm Charts) in sequence. 

## Wiki Sitemap
There's a wealth of instructional and reference information available across the multiple Gateway Developer Tools and Ephemeral Gateway repositories. See what's available from a single list in the Wiki sitemap.
