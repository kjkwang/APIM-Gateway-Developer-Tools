# Getting Started with APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools
This GitHub repository contains the required CA API Gateway developer tools and CI/CD reference implementations for your organization to implement a CI/CD workflow that optimizes both the design and run times of the Container Gateway life cycle in ephemeral mode. 

Design time refers to activities pertaining to the design or development activities of Gateway policy language while run time refers to the activities pertaining to delivery, integration, and deployment activities of the Container Gateway life cycle â€“ automation is used where the described tools allow it.

## About the Beta Release
The Ephemeral Gateway is a work in progress and the contents of this Git repository is intended as a preview for any organization wanting to explore the implementation of a CI/CD workflow for their API Gateway solution development life cyle. We encourage you to give it a try and provide our development and testing teams your valuable feedback! 

### Features
For this first beta release, we've focused on the following features:
* GitHub repository set up for your GitOps workflow for design time and environment configuration
* Gateway Developer Tools to propagate the import, export, and build tasks for your policies and configurations
* Integration with industry-standard CI/CD tools such as Google Kubernetes Engine, Weave Flux, Jenkins, and Nexus

### Applicability and System Requirements
For a high-level overview of the CI/CD workflow and its core components, we highly recommend that you review the [reference architecture](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Ephemeral-Gateway---Reference-Architecture) of the Ephemeral Gateway in the general Wiki.  

| Requirement | Supported/Tested in Beta Version |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway Form Factor(s) | Container Gateway Version 9.3 and newer |
| Cloud Platform(s) | Google Kubernetes Engine |
|Third Party Software/Cloud Native Apps | GitHub, Git, Golang, Jenkins, Weaveflux, Helm, Docker, Nexus |

If you want to learn more about the benefits or an overview of the Ephemeral Gateway, check out our DocOps [documentation](https://docops.ca.com/ca-api-gateway/9-4/en/apis-and-toolkits/gateway-developer-plugin?src=contextnavpagetreemode).

Before diving into the individual developer tools, check out the [general Wiki page](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki) to learn the basic setup for your Ephemeral Gateway, and a reference architecture. 

## Gateway Developer Tools Framework
Gateway Developer Tools consist of these frameworks:

- [gateway-developer-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin) - Reads configuration files, converts them to the Gateway Restman bundle format and builds the GW7 package.
- [gateway-export-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/gateway-export-plugin) - Exports current configurations from an existing Gateway, converts them into the plugin format, and stores it in the local directory structure, allowing for pushing to a VCS system.
- [gateway-import-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/gateway-import-plugin) - Imports and installs generated solutions to an existing running Gateway. Used primarily for transitioning Gateways from an appliance to a container form factor.
* [environment-creator application](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/environment-creator-application) - Part of the the GW7 package and used for deployment, this tool collects all environment properties that are relevant to the container and applies their values to the bundles. It is run before Container Gateway startup.

## Known Limitations
As we push forward to providing the best product and high Time-to-Value with the Ephemeral Gateway, please be aware of the following limitations for this beta release when testing for your own implementation:

| Issue | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Policy Manager and Kubernetes | Policy Manager access to a Kubernetes Gateway cluster is disabled. ||
| Tested Gateway Entities |The following Gateway entities have been tested for the Gateway Developer Plugin: <ul><li>Cassandra Connections</li><li>Encapsulated Assertions</li><li>Identity Providers</li><li>JDBC Connections</li><li>JMS Destinations</li><li>Listen Ports</li><li>Policy Backed Services</li><li>Private Keys</li><li>Scheduled Tasks</li><li>Services</li><li>Static Properties</li><li>Stored Passwords</li><li>Trusted Certificates</li></ul>| All other entities shall be tested in gradual phases, post-beta.|
|Spaces in Environment Variable Names | Environment variable names in a Kubernetes pod container do not accept spaces in names - this may cause issues for any Gateway environmental values with spaces exported to a pod container in Kubernetes (i.e., the pod container will not start).||
| Special Charcters in Context Variables | The export plugin exports special characters in environment values with a backslash in order to escape the character. WeaveWorks' Flux returns an error when attempting to parse backslashes (" \ ") in the values.
|TIBCO JMS |TIBCO JMS is not supported on a Gateway solution built with the Gateway Developer plugin ||
 
## Installation
Prerequisites
1. Have Docker installed.
2. Have an existing Gateway license
3. A running Gateway which has a policy to export. As an example for this getting started guide. You can find it at [Getting Started Gateway](https://github.com/J-Lou/getting-started-developer-plugin). To boot up your running Getting Started Gateway, instructions are provided below.
    1. Open up a terminal in the base directory of the `Getting Started Gateway`.
    2. Place a license in `docker/`
    3. Execute the following commands.
    ```console
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    $ docker-compose up --force-recreate
    ```
    **Note**: The IP address of this Gateway is https://localhost:844
