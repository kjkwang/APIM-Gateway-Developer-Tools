This GitHub repository serves as a launchpad and sitemap for the CA API Gateway developer tools and CI/CD reference implementations for your organization to implement a CI/CD workflow for your Container Gateway solution development life cycle in ephemeral mode.  
There are two parts to the CI/CD workflow: design time and run time. 

#### Design Time :
Design Time refers to activities pertaining to the design or development activities of Gateway policy language.

#### Run Time :
Run Time refers to the activities pertaining to delivery, integration, and deployment activities of the Container Gateway life cycle â€“ automation is used where the described tools allow it.
