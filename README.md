# Welcome to APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools
This GitHub repository serves as a launchpad and sitemap for the CA API Gateway developer tools and CI/CD reference implementations for your organization to implement a CI/CD workflow for your Container Gateway solution development life cycle in ephemeral mode.  

There are two parts to the CI/CD workflow: design time and run time. Design time refers to activities pertaining to the design or development activities of Gateway policy language while run time refers to the activities pertaining to delivery, integration, and deployment activities of the Container Gateway life cycle â€“ automation is used where the described tools allow it.

## About the Beta Release
The Ephemeral Gateway is a work in progress and the contents of this Git repository is intended as a preview for any organization wanting to explore the implementation of a CI/CD workflow for their API Gateway solution development life cyle. We encourage you to give it a try and provide our development and testing teams your valuable feedback! 

### Features
For this first beta release, we've focused on the following features:
* GitHub repository set up for your GitOps workflow for design time and environment configuration
* Gateway Developer Tools to propagate the import, export, and build tasks for your policies and configurations
* Integration with industry-standard CI/CD tools such as Google Kubernetes Engine, Weave Flux, Jenkins, and Nexus

### Applicability and System Requirements
For a high-level overview of the CI/CD workflow and its core components, we highly recommend that you review the [reference architecture](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Ephemeral-Gateway-Reference-Architecture) of the Ephemeral Gateway in the general Wiki.  

| Requirement | Supported/Tested in Beta Version |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway Form Factor(s) | Container Gateway Version 9.3 and newer |
| Container Orchestration Platform(s) | Google Kubernetes Engine Version 1.15 |
|Other Third Party Software | GitHub, Git, Golang, Jenkins, Weaveflux, Helm, Docker, Nexus - all latest versions as of June 2019 |

If you want to learn more about the benefits or an overview of the Ephemeral Gateway, check out our DocOps [documentation](https://docops.ca.com/ca-api-gateway/9-4/en/apis-and-toolkits/gateway-developer-plugin?src=contextnavpagetreemode).

## Gateway Developer Tools Framework
Gateway Developer Tools consist of these frameworks:

| Tool | Function |
| --- | --- |
| [gateway-developer-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin) |Reads configuration files, converts them to the Gateway Restman bundle format and builds the GW7 package.|
|[gateway-export-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/gateway-export-plugin) |Exports current configurations from an existing Gateway, converts them into the plugin format, and stores it in the local directory structure, allowing for pushing to a VCS system.|
|[gateway-import-plugin](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/gateway-import-plugin)|Imports and installs generated solutions to an existing running Gateway. Used primarily for transitioning Gateways from an appliance to a container form factor.|
|[environment-creator application](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-plugin/tree/master/environment-creator-application)| Part of the the GW7 package and used for deployment, this tool collects all environment properties that are relevant to the container and applies their values to the bundles. It is run before Container Gateway startup.|


Before diving into the individual developer tools, check out the [general Wiki page](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki) to learn the basic setup for your Ephemeral Gateway, and a reference architecture. 
## Known Limitations
See [Known Limitations](https://github.com/CAAPIM/APIM-Gateway-Developer-Tools/wiki/Known-Limitations) in the Wiki.

## Installation 
### Prerequisites for Policy Developers
1. Have Docker installed.
2. Have an existing Gateway license
3. A running Gateway which has a policy to export. As an example for this getting started guide. You can find it at [Getting Started Gateway](https://github.com/J-Lou/getting-started-developer-plugin). To boot up your running Getting Started Gateway, instructions are provided below.
    1. Open up a terminal in the base directory of the `Getting Started Gateway`.
    2. Place a license in `docker/`
    3. Execute the following commands.
    ```console
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    $ docker-compose up --force-recreate
    ```
    **Note**: The IP address of this Gateway is https://localhost:844

| Repository | Description|
| --- | --- |
| [gateway-developer-skeleton-repo](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-skeleton-repo) | Provides the basic reference file structure and implementation for you to create your own Container Gateway solution repository in GitHub. This repository is suitable for anyone wanting to 1) Apply GitOps principles to their Gateway policy development and 2) Use the Gateway developer plugin for import/exporting of Gateway artifacts. At the end, you should be able to understand how a Version Control System (i.e., GitHub), the CA Gateway Developer plugin, and Docker can work together to support your Container Gateway design time activities. |
|[Sample Gateway Project for export](https://github.com/J-Lou/getting-started-developer-plugin)| Used in conjunction with the Gateway Developer Skeleton repository, this repository contains the files and folders of an existing and running Gateway for exporting with the Gateway Developer plugin.|
|[gateway-developer-multimodule-skeleton-repo](https://github.com/CAAPIM/gateway-developer-multimodule-skeleton-repo)| A step up from the single-module skeleton module, you can use this repository as a starting point for your gateway projects with a multi-module structure. Each module is typically represented by one unique folder in the Gateway file structure and bundle dependencies may be added.|
|[ephemeral-gateway-skeleton-repo](https://github.com/CAAPIM/ephemeral-gateway-skeleton-repo)|Clone this repository to experiment with more advanced use cases such as integrating the developer plugin with the runtime environment. This repository is a superset of the single-module repository, containing required files and configurations for connectivity to Jenkins.|
|[example-environment-configuration-repo](https://github.com/CAAPIM/example-environment-configuration-repo)|This repository is dedicated to environment configurations and is set up to demonstrate Weave Flux actions. It contains two sample developer and testing environments.
